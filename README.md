Protecting the Board – Entry Pattern Analysis Case Study

(Simulated Data Project for Gaming Operations & Fraud Prevention)

Overview

This project is a hands-on case study I built to demonstrate how I analyze player-entry behavior, detect suspicious patterns, and think through fraud prevention from a gaming-operations perspective. The goal of this project is to show how I break down data, identify risks, and explain operational decisions clearly.

All data in this project is fictional and intentionally designed to mimic patterns that gaming operations teams deal with: entry mirroring, multi-accounting behavior, unrealistic win rates, and correlated/staged entries.

Objective

The purpose of this case study is to recreate a realistic review scenario that a Gaming Ops or Risk team might see during daily monitoring. The analysis focuses on:
	•	Identifying repeat patterns across multiple accounts
	•	Flagging high-risk behavioral signals
	•	Evaluating correlation between entry legs
	•	Reviewing timing, stake size, and user clustering
	•	Determining which accounts require escalation or action
	•	Explaining the reasoning behind each conclusion

What This Project Demonstrates

This project reflects practical skills such as:
	•	Pattern recognition
	•	Decision-making under uncertainty
	•	Clear verbal and written communication
	•	Fraud awareness in sports-gaming environments
	•	Attention to detail
	•	Analytical reasoning
	•	Ability to document risk signals and provide justification

A short summary of the dataset, the goals of the review, and what the entries represent.

Page 2 — Behavioral Analysis

This section explains the reasoning behind each flagged behavior, including:
	•	Mirrored entries across multiple UserIDs
	•	Same-leg combinations placed within seconds of each other
	•	Power Play / Flex combinations matching across accounts
	•	Suspicious win-rate patterns
	•	Timing clusters suggesting coordination
	•	Stake inconsistencies across linked entries

The tone is professional and operational — similar to what an analyst would write when explaining an escalation to Risk or Fraud.

Page 3 — Final Decision Tree

A simple escalation outline that includes:
	•	Low-risk actions
	•	Medium-risk actions
	•	High-risk actions
	•	When to escalate
	•	When to freeze
	•	When to allow

The purpose is to show how I evaluate severity and choose the next step based on behavior, impact, and credibility.

Page 4 — Sample Entry Table (Simulated Players)

A recreated entry table that includes:
	•	EntryID
	•	UserID
	•	Sport
	•	Type (Power / Flex / etc.)
	•	Stake
	•	Timestamp
	•	All legs included in the entry

The player names used are retired athletes to avoid referencing any real active players or real data. This protects integrity while still making the patterns realistic.

Closing Notes

This project is not meant to represent any specific company’s internal tools or processes. It is simply a personal demonstration of how I analyze data, interpret patterns, and communicate operational decisions.

My intention with this project is to show a human element and tranpsrency but also that I understand what it takes to protect a platform from abuse — whether that’s stopping multi-accounting, spotting unusual entry behavior, or identifying patterns that could harm the fairness of the game.
